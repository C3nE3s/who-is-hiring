# Who is Hiring

This is a script to pull down the hacker news "who's hiring" post and parse and sort it.
Currently the values and algos are hard coded and will spit them out in CSV format

## Possible Future Plans

If time permits, I would love to opensource this, as the current opensource solutions available are subpar IMO. I would add features like:

- convert script into working web server API
- allow for the passing of a client sort map for customization
- automate updating and pulling down posts (new monthly posts and keeping live ones updated)
- combine job postings w/ data from glassdoor, cruchbase, etc

I would love to see this become an application that helps folks in tech get jobs.
