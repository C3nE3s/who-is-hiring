We don't hire for this team very often, but we're looking to hire a couple of people now.  Several of the people we've hired have come from prior monthly Who's Hiring threads. This is a great role for somebody who loves startups and is interested in being part of the YC startup community, and wants to own projects from start-to-finish.

That said, we encourage everyone to participate in all of YC -- read applications, join our batch talks, help out with Demo Day and speak up on the projects you'd want to work on. The software team you'd be joining has about ten people with lots of collective years of start-up and big company experience, so you'll get the best of both worlds: moving fast and shipping and strong teammates/mentors to help you learn. About half of us are YC alums and several of us are parents. We're open to people 2+ years out of school or with 10+ years of experience. Lastly, the work-life balance and compensation are great, and you get to work with people across the company. YC is fully remote and is hiring people anywhere in the US.

If you own a building with leases to tenants, you need insurance - whether the economy is growing or not. It is also an industry that has not evolved to use modern technology: workflows are manual, communication is messy and time-consuming, and people often don't know what they're buying or why they're buying it. Obie sells commercial real estate insurance in a new way: one that emphasizes transparency and human-centric automation. We are a venture-backed technology company. Our early success is in large part due to our unwavering standards in hiring. We recognize that our product is only as good as the people building and promoting it. We look for individuals who find solutions by going through the cycle of ideation to implementation with curiosity, rigor and a highly analytical lens. At Obie, we judge people based on the merit of their work. If you are passionate about what this role entails, are excited by solving real problems, and you want to help shape the future of commercial real estate, we want to hear from you. We're based in Chicago, have an office in Florida, and remote employees across the US and Canada. We welcome US/Canadian based remote applicants, but be warned: we'll try to persuade you to move to the City by the Lake. Email me directly for more info or to set up a chat!

You know it requires discipline, thought, moments of joy and pain, but in the end it will result in something beautiful.

We will keep it short: we have quite some work ahead of us. I mean: quite a lot (not Alot). So the answer is easy: we cannot handle it on our own and can use some help. Your main set of skills revolves around the .NET world, but you are a person of many traits and although you are fluent in C# you do speak a couple of words across the other side of an API.

We are not perfect, but who is? Foremost we offer you an enjoyable, but honest and real, environment to work in. When should you apply:
If you are ready for a new challenge of course, but also ready to commit. Really, do not come job-hopping, we also do not want to employee-hop.

You'll be hands-on in the codebase, but you'll also be responsible for feature/roadmap planning, making tech choices for upcoming features/tools, writing tech specs for others to implement, reviewing code, managing releases, and helping to analyze results. Familiarity with every piece of our stack is not required, as long as you can get up to speed fast on both the game client and the backend.

Spare Platform encompasses a sophisticated back-end with a host of adjustable service parameters and an accessible front-end that keeps riders and drivers informed in real-time. It can handle any service configuration, optimize trips by pooling riders across these different service categories onto the same vehicle, and engage third-party fleets. Ideal use cases for the platform include first/last mile transit, taxi and ride-hail, paratransit, and on-demand transportation.

With this in mind, Spare has seamlessly integrated several smart transportation services on top of the powerful Spare Platform. From the apps to the dispatcher tools, Spare has focused on building an integrated experience where transportation experience is connected – not fragmented.

It is a Ruby on Rails app fully running on AWS. We use React on the front-end, Postgres and MySQL on the backend, along with Redis, Elasticsearch and more openstack tech. As with any mature stack, we have incurred some technical debt and a current focus of ours is to aggressively bring this down in the coming year. We are looking for multiple senior hires to fulfill those needs. You will be a great fit for the role if you have experience with past projects upgrading RoR stacks, MySQL, Postgres and ElasticSearch, or on the DevOps side, architecting continuous delivery using tools such as CloudFormation, Puppet, Capistrano. SecOps experience is also welcome, e.g. with SOC2 compliance, Hashicorp Vault, SonarQube and similar.
The ideal candidate will have several years of leadership experience with teams of engineers, and willing to own technical execution on projects and collaborate on the roadmap with our amazing product team. For lead roles, expect a team of up to 5 and >50% hands-on work. If you are not interested in leadership but have the technical chops in spades, we may still consider you for a staff/principal engineer role. IT Glue is part of Kaseya, a much larger group serving the MSP space. As such we offer competitive packages and benefits. If you are in the region of Vancouver, BC, Canada, or Miami, Florida, you will be able to work in the office at your convenience. My name is Olivier; I am in charge of the Engineering group at IT Glue and you can contact me directly if you are interested.

,"We are a super un-sexy, VC-backed, revenue-generating, Trade Finance automation company (think Pipe for the real world) that's bringing the the $10tn Trade Finance space in to the 21st century. The problem we're solving When Walmart gives La Croix a $100k order for seltzer, not only does Walmart not pay after receiving goods for 3-4 months but La Croix has to cover the cost of actually making their goods for a bunch of time (months). As a small business, this sucks hard. Fishtail will lend to La Croix when they get an order from Walmart so they can satisfy demand without tying up huge amounts of working capital. Usually banks will lend to folks only when the product makes it to Walmart (and only to large companies, who don't traditionally need $) -- the net effect of Fishtail is that we lend earlier in the chain to smaller businesses (which is a super duper hard problem). Tech stack Our web stack is Ruby on Rails + turbo/stimulus/tailwind - data stack is python/pytorch + spark. We get a boatload of data tracking every vessel in the water/every plane in the sky (among other datasets like every trade transaction that has happened over the past N years). Fun fact We have a sustainability-linked trade finance product where we can tie the interest rate of our loans to the sustainability of the individual shipment (i.e. the greener the shipment, the better your interest rate) -- this is super nifty when you consider that transportation is responsible for ~30% of the world's green house gas emissions and there's really no good way to identify the best option to get from A to B. What we need We're looking for support taking our product to the next level on all fronts (engineering, data, sales, marketing/propaganda, etc) but are mostly looking for more data people and web people to help us build out our credit/performance risk models + customer-facing product.

OpenRegulatory | Person Who Builds Things and Ships Software | Remote | Full-Time | 60-80k € + revenue share |,"Are you tired of corporate politics, unproductive meetings and repeatedly building stuff which never got shipped? The VC-funded startup chaos? I certainly was. I got tired of the typical startup game: Lots of funding, a questionable product, no customers, many meetings and countless interruptions. Instead, I wanted to build a company that got back to the basics. Like being profitable and building stuff which customers love and pay for. And most importantly, I wanted to call the shots on certain things: We're not using Slack, because Slack interrupts people and is a crappy project management tool (we use Basecamp instead). We don't care how many hours you work. If you get the job done and respond to messages within a reasonable time frame, that's fine! If you get stuff done faster, take the rest of the day off. I like to take long naps in the afternoon. We're currently on a 4-day workweek (probably forever). We don't have any sort of corporate spending policy. You'll get a company credit card and full access to our bank account. Buy what you need. What about you? You love building things. You've discovered programming which enabled you to build many things fast. You have a fair amount of experience in different programming languages. After cycling through many new, shiny tech stacks, you've arrived at the conclusion that productivity is at its highest when using old-school, proven technology that gets out of your way. Like Rails. And tailwindcss! Simply implementing requirements which were brought to you by product managers has become too boring for you. You're looking for opportunities to influence the direction of product development further upstream, getting regular feedback and sometimes talking to customers. You're looking for a solid job, where you can apply good craftsmanship to a product which users love and pay for. Your grades and (University) education are nice to know, but ultimately don't matter much. Pay range (yearly, incl. German tax): 60-80k € + revenue share. Apply by sending your CV and a short reasoning why you don't want to work for Google to oliver at openregulatory.com.

"Oso | Engineering Leader, Software Engineer, Developer Advocate, Product Leader | New York City (NYC) | Onsite or Remote","Over the last 15 years, companies like AWS, Stripe, and Twilio have helped developers offload anything not core to their apps so they can focus on what matters to their users. Despite a lot of progress in developer tooling, most developers still roll their own authorization. You might start with something quick 'n dirty – some IF statements and roles in a database, which may not be pretty but gets the job done...until you need to add more features, and more features. And inevitably every team band-aids onto this system until they do a big refactor. This is lost time for an area that's not core to what most companies are trying to solve for their users, and what's more, no one on the team is feeling great about this work. At Oso (backed by Sequoia), we're building the first batteries-included framework for authorization so developers don't have to roll it on their own ever again. We're designing slick APIs to cut down the amount of time they spend getting their system set up, and building a fully-fledged policy engine and programming language (in Rust) under the hood to ensure they can customize their system however they need. We don't have any product managers – the engineers on the team are responsible for taking broad problems, experimenting with potential solutions and shipping a superhuman experience for our users.

Our team is distributed throughout the world and is mainly operating remotely. We're currently getting our headquarter running in Miami, with offices in the Bay Area and Munich, Germany. Many people prefer remote work and excel at it, therefore we intend to keep remote-first teams. Since we only recently transitioned from our prototype/beta phase, we are still building out the system. Therefore, you can actively shape how our core system and tech stack looks, works and grows. Time to build! Just some tech buzzwords so people can find themselves somewhere in there. This is by far not an exhaustive list and should give a glimpse in what tech we use/might use and what other experience seems fitting. Positions are primarily targeted at people at least Senior. * Data Engineer: Kafka, AWS, Lambda, RabbitMq, Python (Scala, Java) * Backend Engineer: Python, Django, FastAPI (Ruby, Rails, PHP, Laravel, Erlang, Elixir, Node, Go, Rust) * Frontend Engineer: React (Typescript, D3, Angular, Vue, Vanilla JS, yeah ... all the other js-stuff) * Data Scientist: Time series analysis, Python, Numpy, Pandas, Jupyter (maybe the only role where I think a formal education would be nice, but proof me wrong) * Machine Learning Engineer: Backtesting, Modelling, Python (MLOps, NLP, Sklearn, PyTorch) * Cloud Engineer: Docker, AWS, EC2, Terraform (Heroku, Digital Ocean, GCP, Azure) * Database Engineer: Postgres, TimescaleDB, ClickHouse (SQL, Influx, Snowflake) * DevOps Engineer: Kubernetes, Terraform, Bash (Jenkins, Circle.ci, GH Actions) In summary: We are actually looking for people who either own their respective domain (e.g. Ops guy who has written k8s himself in bash) or can perform mostly across the entire stack (give me rails/django and I can get a SAAS up and running in no time).

"Symmetry Investments | Many Varied Roles | REMOTE or VISA (London, Hong Kong, Singapore, Jersey) | D, Julia, Kotlin, other functional and systems languages | Full-Time, Fixed Term, Flexible","## Roles we are hiring for - Business Analysts: business analysis, documentation, team and tool design - Native Code Developers: We are looking for outstanding native code developers who would like to write D.  Our experience has been that strong C and C++ developers can learn D quite quickly. - Functional programmers to work with practitioners in delivering value to the business using Symmetry Integration Language. - Documentation: At Symmetry we recognise the value of writing and have for example a Pulitzer prize-winning former WSJ journalist and a maintainer of Linux Kernel Newbies documentation.  We are looking for people to write technical documentation and to document data structures and processes (open to varying range of technical ability depending on the project). - Front end design: designers - ideally with some ability to program - to work on usability and aesthetics for our applications and other information-presenting systems, on both web and desktop - Designers for documentation:  Now that non-programming internal work is moving to markdown in git, we are hiring designers to work on templates and mini-logos for documentation and other work. - Data Science: time series analysis in particular, including high frequency data sets that are too big for simple tools - Information Security: incident response, threat intelligence, vuln management - Platform: Platform as Code, Site Reliability Engineers, Windows desktop support; frontline server support and administration; application support - Legal and Compliance: #lawyerswhocode or who are very comfortable working with markdown in git - Accounting: are you the sort of person who would use #ledger-cli ?  If so, we would like to hear from you. - Business: risk, operations, administrative, organisational design and business strategy, investor relations processes, talent acquisition - Investment: Economics, Quant, Portfolio Research, Investment Research, Portfolio Management and Trading - Market Data: contract administration, data cleaning, alternative data research and management Location: Remote or sponsorship for a visa in London, Hong Kong, Singapore, Jersey Term: full-time permanent, fixed-term contract, flexible hours. ## Languages - Dlang (D) - Typescript - Kotlin - we do not use but value experience in modern C++, beautiful C, Haskell, Ocaml, Rust, Elm ## Qualities and traits we value - Courage and daring - Phronesis (practical wisdom), common sense and commercial orientation - Practical people who are at the same time unreasonable when they ought to be - Highly individual people oriented to promoting survival and flourishing of the group - Inclination and ability to notice and understand links between seemingly-unrelated things - Curiosity - Extreme motivation - Mechanical sympathy - Extreme and unusual intellectual capabilities - A love of tinkering - Resourcefulness - Good taste and love of beauty ## About Us Symmetry Investments is a post startup USD 9+ billion alternative asset management company with around 250 people across multiple time zones and locations. Our core technology team has been remote-first for some time, and the whole company is following suit, accelerated by the pandemic. I'm co-CEO and co-COO, responsible amongst other things for technology across the firm and I’m posting this myself. That should give you an idea both about how seriously we take technology and the culture of the firm. We are five years into a period of transformation from what was initially a fairly standard enterprise finance technology approach to something new that recognises the importance of both the humane and the technical for discretionary portfolio management and for the business of running an alternative investment manager.  [Amaury Sechet]( It's not easy to integrate practitioners who may spend most of their day programming, but are oriented towards solving business problems, with developers who are specialists in programming. To achieve this, we wrote a little functional DSL that's now in production. Type inference of returns and parameters using inequality constraints is in a feature branch and there is plenty more to do on the language itself as well as the ecosystem around it. SIL can compile and call C++, D, and C# at runtime and interoperate with Python and R. What might be a project in itself elsewhere can be just a set of functions in Symmetry Integration Language. The language is written in D and we have a close involvement with the D Foundation and community, hosting DConf in London.  So we are looking for outstanding native code developers who would like to write D as well as people to work with practitioners writing Symmetry Integration Language. Also looking for people to write documentation and work on the build. It's quite a creative place where we encourage a degree of courage amidst practical constraints, and we are open to doing things a different way if it's commercially sound and in the interests of our investors. We look for virtues and capabilities over only experience and credentials although those things aren't a disadvantage. Do not let a lack of credentials or qualifications prevent you from applying. We've recently hired experts with C++, Common Lisp, D, Haxe, Haskell, Julia and Perl backgrounds, and are happy to bring them up to speed with the tools we use. Compensation is currently not quite at Netflix standards but is generous to very generous over time by broad technology industry standards. We recognise and reward technical accomplishment and have a very flat structure - don't be surprised if our founder and Chief Investment Officer starts asking you questions about your work. ## Symmetry Talks - Presenting SIL-cling to Compiler Research Group at Princeton ( - Symmetry Internship Project - calling C++ from SIL ( - All Spreadsheets Must Die ( - Lessons from a DSL where all you have is Ranges ( - Alternative Investment Management ( ## Links - Symmetry GitHub ( # Contact - Please apply using this link ( ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhR4PSExnqk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhR4PSExnqk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es6U7WAlKpQ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es6U7WAlKpQ https://dlang.org/blog/2019/10/15/my-vision-of-ds-future/ https://dlang.org/blog/2019/10/15/my-vision-of-ds-future/ https://youtu.be/7teqrCNzrD8 https://youtu.be/7teqrCNzrD8 http://dconf.org/2020/online/index.html#alexandru http://dconf.org/2020/online/index.html#alexandru https://youtu.be/FZi9CSB9_kk https://youtu.be/FZi9CSB9_kk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtuzSlKRmzA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtuzSlKRmzA https://youtu.be/1rMq-4rWgis https://youtu.be/1rMq-4rWgis https://github.com/symmetryinvestments https://github.com/symmetryinvestments https://jobs.lever.co/symmetryinvestments/c8a9b95e-bdf0-459c-a79f-120acdffbd0b?lever-origin=applied&lever-source%5B%5D=hackernews https://jobs.lever.co/symmetryinvestments/c8a9b95e-bdf0-459c-a79f-120acdffbd0b?lever-origin=applied&lever-source%5B%5D=hackernews ,1646208565,21

We do too! :) Open-source We are a team of veteran open-source developers, working on educational and community-based projects in an open-first environment – and we are looking for new members. By joining us, you will work full-time on open-source, pushing your changes to free software projects upstream through pull requests, contributing features, documentation, or help on public forums. We care deeply about contributing our work upstream. You will see the results of your work reused and recognized across the educational community, increasing access to quality education for everyone, everywhere.

For the past 7 years, we have based and refined our way of working around remote-friendly workflows, from the ground up.

We are a couple of friends who recently founded a research & development & trading company mostly focused on crypto.","We are already making good profits from trading & investments but have also just started building various tools, apps, smart contracts, bots and related tech to support our operations and increase our profits even more. And now is the time to share it with the right people. Our culture is an engineer & maker culture. We have some people onboard who combined possess a fair understanding of topics such as economics, statistics, investing, trading, psychology, computer science, operating systems, programming, networking, security, devops, the internet, the web, the blockchain, incentive design and tokenomics. I'm not disclosing the identity of our company (we have no good reason to announce our existence to the public at this time), but I'm disclosing my own identity as I realize that the target audience of this post (hopefully you) needs to know who they would be working with if they pursue this opportunity. I am an experienced full stack developer, a product engineer having a lot of startup experience, and a significant crypto exposure. Check out my fancy webpage ( Our development philosophy is to always aim for quality and simplicity with a pragmatic touch when it comes either to the team, product, or processes.

We have a small team of talented generalists with a hacker attitude, a deep understanding of the ""web operating system"", and a sense of humor. And we're looking to expand this team (but not too much). We are not looking for the mythical full stack developer who is an expert on everything, say, ES2118, CSS, responsive design, GraphQL, AWS, Kubernetes, Solidity and shit. Instead we are looking for people who have a proper foundation on programming in general and the web platform, a strong intellectual curiosity, and the experience & ability to make good judgements when it comes either to technology choices, architectural choices, implementation details, analysis, prioritization, and interaction with customers (internal & external). This is what's important. Specifics can be learned. No one cares if you know flexbox or not. Or funky sorting algorithms. Or React hooks. Or NFTs. We are very selective when it comes to the projects we work on, people we work with, partnerships we establish and tools & ecosystems we build on top of. It's not only about making money but it's about making it while having a pleasant experience & fun, learning stuff that is worth learning, building a proper reputation, investing in projects & ecosystems & people that will increasingly benefit us and be worth our very precious time in the longer term.
